# OpenLap — Free Motorsport Telemetry Overlay Software

**OpenLap** is a free, open-source desktop application that overlays telemetry data on racing video footage. It supports **RaceBox**, **AIM MyChron**, **MoTeC**, and **GPX** data sources and runs entirely on your PC — no subscription, no cloud, no fees.

Point it at your telemetry files and a folder of race videos, and it matches sessions, syncs timing, and renders professional gauge overlays — all from a single window.

> Licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3**. Free forever. Forks must stay open source.

## Quick Start (Windows — no technical knowledge needed)

No Python, no FFmpeg, no installation required. Everything is bundled.

**1. Download**

Go to **[Releases](https://github.com/LaurensVR3/OpenLap/releases/latest)** and download the `.zip` file.

**2. Unzip**

Extract the zip anywhere — your Desktop, `C:\Tools\OpenLap`, wherever you like. You will get a folder containing `OpenLap.exe` and a folder called `_internal`.

> **Important:** keep `OpenLap.exe` and the `_internal` folder together in the same location at all times. Moving just the `.exe` will break the app.

**3. Run**

Double-click `OpenLap.exe`.

> **Windows SmartScreen warning?** Windows shows this for all software that isn't commercially signed. OpenLap is open source and safe. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

**4. Set up your folders (Settings tab)**

When the app opens, go to the **Settings tab first** and tell it where your files live:

- **RaceBox folder** — the folder where your RaceBox `.csv` files are stored
- **AIM folder** — the folder containing your AIM `.xrk` / `.xrz` / `.drk` files
- **MoTeC folder** — the folder containing your MoTeC `.ld` files
- **GPX folder** — the folder containing your `.gpx` files
- **Video folder** — the folder where your race videos are stored
- **Export folder** — where finished videos will be saved

You only need to fill in the sources you actually use.

**First-time setup for AIM users:** click **Download DLL** in the AIM section. This fetches the conversion library that reads `.xrk` files. You only need to do this once.

**First-time setup for RaceBox cloud users:** click **Download Login Component**, wait for it to finish, then click **Check Auth** and log in with your RaceBox account.

**5. Scan your sessions (Data tab)**

Go to the **Data tab**. Sessions are scanned automatically on startup — they will appear grouped by date. If nothing shows up, click **Scan**.

Each session shows its laps and whether a matching video was found:
- `✓ user` — sync confirmed, ready to export
- `~ auto` — sync detected automatically (blue); scrub to verify, click **Confirm** to lock it in
- `≈ unset` — no sync offset set yet; use the Align Video panel to set it manually
- `no vid` — no matching video found; click **Browse for video…** to link one manually

**6. Set the sync offset**

The sync offset tells OpenLap exactly where in the video the lap timer starts. Without it, gauges will be out of step with the footage.

- **Auto-sync (recommended):** enable **Auto Sync** in Settings. After scanning, OpenLap cross-correlates video motion against G-force to detect the offset automatically. Works best with RaceBox, AIM, and MoTeC data. GPX files do not contain G-force, so auto-sync will not run for GPX sessions.
- **Manual sync:** in the Data tab, select a session and use the **Align Video** panel. Scrub the video to the exact moment the lap timer starts, then click **Mark**.

**7. Edit the overlay (Overlay tab)**

Click **Open in Overlay →** on any session to jump to the editor.

- Use the lap selector (◀ ▶ or dropdown) to switch between laps
- Click **Add Gauge** to place a new element — pick a channel (Speed, RPM, G-force, etc.) and a style
- Drag gauges to reposition; drag the corner handle to resize
- Switch themes (Dark · Light · Colorful · Monochrome) using the theme picker
- Save your layout as a named preset so you can reuse it

**8. Export (Export tab)**

Click **+ Export** on the lap or session you want, then go to the **Export tab**.

- Choose scope: **This Lap**, **Fastest Lap**, **All Laps**, or **Full Session**
- Choose encoder: OpenLap auto-detects your GPU (NVIDIA NVENC · AMD AMF · Intel QSV). If no GPU is found it falls back to CPU (libx264) — this is slower but always works
- Click **Start Export**. Progress and a log are shown live. Finished videos are saved to your Export Folder.

## Troubleshooting

**Sessions are not appearing in the Data tab**
- Check that the correct folder is set in Settings for your data source
- Make sure the files are the right type (`.csv` for RaceBox, `.xrk`/`.xrz`/`.drk` for AIM, `.ld` for MoTeC, `.gpx` for GPX)
- Click **Scan** to force a rescan
- AIM files also need the DLL downloaded (Settings → Download DLL)

**No video matched to a session**
- OpenLap matches by timestamp. Make sure your camera clock is roughly correct
- Use **Browse for video…** in the Data tab to link a video manually
- Supported video formats: anything FFmpeg can read (MP4, MOV, MTS, AVI, etc.)

**Auto-sync did nothing / sync is wrong**
- Auto-sync requires G-force data. GPX sessions do not have G-force — use manual sync instead
- If confidence was too low the result is discarded. Use manual sync via the Align Video panel
- A manually set offset (`✓ user`) is never overwritten by auto-sync

**Export failed or produced no output**
- Check the log in the Export tab for the specific error
- Make sure the Export Folder is set in Settings and the folder actually exists
- Try switching to the CPU encoder (libx264) if a GPU encoder fails

**App crashes on launch**
- Make sure `OpenLap.exe` and the `_internal` folder are in the same directory — never move the `.exe` on its own

## Features

### Data & Session Management
- Per-source telemetry folders — configure separate directories for RaceBox, AIM, MoTeC, and GPX data
- Auto-scan on startup with persistent session cache for fast restarts
- Sessions grouped by date with lap list, best time, and video match status
- Manual video reassignment for sessions where auto-matching doesn't find the right clip
- Multi-clip support — multiple video segments per session are joined automatically before rendering
- **Auto-sync** (opt-in): cross-correlates video motion against G-force to detect the sync offset automatically after each scan — results appear as `~ auto` and can be confirmed or fine-tuned in the Data tab
- Frame-accurate manual sync: scrub the video preview to where the lap timer starts, press **Mark** — saves as a `✓ user` offset that auto-sync will never overwrite
- RaceBox cloud download directly from the app (requires a RaceBox account)
- AIM `.xrk` / `.xrz` / `.drk` files are converted to CSV on first scan using the AIM MatLabXRK DLL

### Overlay Editor
- Live video preview with scrub bar — see exactly how gauges look on your footage before exporting
- Freely positionable, resizable gauge elements — drag to move, drag corner handle to resize
- Element-to-element snapping with cyan alignment guides; size snaps to 5% grid
- Lap selector — switch between laps while the video preview stays in sync
- **4 overlay themes**: Dark · Light · Colorful · Monochrome
- **Gauge styles**: Numeric · Bar · Dial · Line · Delta · Compare · Lean · G-Meter · Splits · Sector Bar · Multi-Line · Circuit Map · Zoomed Map · Scoreboard · Info · Image/Logo
- Bike mode — enables Lean gauge and reads lean angle from compatible devices
- Reference lap overlay — compare any lap against a reference with live delta time
- Named preset layouts — save, load, and switch overlay configurations

### Export
- **Scope**: This Lap, Fastest Lap, All Laps (one file per lap), or Full Session
- GPU-accelerated encoding with auto-detection: NVENC (NVIDIA) · AMF (AMD) · QSV (Intel) · libx264 (CPU fallback)
- Adjustable quality (CRF) and parallel worker count
- Configurable pre/post lap padding
- Progress bar and log output per render job

### Extensibility
- Plugin-based style system — drop a `.py` file into `styles/` and it appears in the UI automatically
- All styles receive theme colour tokens; custom styles support all four themes with no extra work

## Run from source

Works on Windows and macOS.

**Requirements**

- Python 3.10+
- FFmpeg available on your system `PATH` (`brew install ffmpeg` on macOS)

**Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -e .
```

On macOS the Cocoa backend is already pulled in via PyObjC when pywebview is installed, so no extra step is needed. If you see errors about `AppKit` or `WebKit`, make sure pywebview itself was installed successfully.

For RaceBox cloud download (optional):

```bash
pip install -e ".[racebox-download]"
playwright install chromium
```

**Run**

```bash
python main.py
```

Configuration is stored at `~/.openlap/config.json`.

Track JSON (lap splitting start/finish lines):

- Put your private track configs under `tracks/` as `*.json` (for example `tracks/guangzhou.json`).
- Real track json files are intentionally gitignored; only `*.template.json` is committed.
- Use `tracks/track.template.json` as the schema starter.

**Known macOS limitations**

- AIM `.xrk` / `.xrz` / `.drk` conversion is unavailable — AIM only ships the required `MatLabXRK` library as a Windows DLL. RaceBox CSV, MoTeC `.ld`, and GPX files work normally.
- Hardware-accelerated encoding uses **VideoToolbox** (`h264_videotoolbox`). NVENC / AMF / QSV are Windows/Linux only.
